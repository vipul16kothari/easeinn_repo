You are an expert full-stack software architect and product builder. I want to build a **simple yet powerful hotel check-in software** for my property. Help me build this end-to-end.

This is a web-based tool (or tablet-friendly mobile app) that will be used by hotel staff (front desk) to manage check-ins, capture guest information, and monitor real-time room availability.

## 🎫 Guest Check-In Flow

Create a guest check-in form that captures the following information:

- Full Name
- Phone Number (preferably WhatsApp)
- Address
- Where they came from (City/Location)
- Check-In Date (dd-mm-yyyy)
- Check-In Time (hh:mm)
- Nationality
- Number of Males
- Number of Females
- Number of Children
- Room Number allocated
- Purpose of Visit
- Destination/Going Back To
- Digital Signature capture (touch input or image)

The form should:
- Validate mandatory fields
- Store all entries in a searchable backend (Firebase, Supabase, or SQLite)
- Auto-tag the room as "Occupied" once assigned

## 🛏️ Hotel Owner Dashboard (Real-Time Room Inventory View)

Build a visual inventory grid showing room availability in real time. For example:

| Room No | Type     | Status     |
|---------|----------|------------|
| 101     | Deluxe   | Available  |
| 102     | Standard | Occupied   |
| 103     | Suite    | Cleaning   |
| ...     | ...      | ...        |

Hotel staff should be able to:
- View all rooms for a specific date
- See which rooms are booked, available, under maintenance, or blocked
- Search/filter by room type or status

## 🧠 Add Any Other Must-Have Features for v1

Suggest any other essential features that should be part of v1 to make this operational and useful from day one. Think like a hotel owner:
- View past check-ins
- Export guest register (PDF or CSV)
- Flag guests for repeat visits
- Print check-in slip or invoice (optional)
- Admin login with limited roles (e.g., staff vs. owner)

---

Please provide:
1. A basic schema (ERD or JSON format) for storing guest data and room inventory
2. High-level frontend structure (React, Next.js, or your recommendation)
3. Backend suggestions (Firebase, Supabase, Node.js, etc.)
4. Optionally: Starter code or open-source boilerplates that can speed up dev

Let’s build this together step by step. Start by suggesting architecture and data model first.
