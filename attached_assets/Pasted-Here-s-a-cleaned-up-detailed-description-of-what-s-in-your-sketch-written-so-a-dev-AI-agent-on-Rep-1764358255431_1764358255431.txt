* On login, they see the **Hotel Dashboard**.

**Goal**: Configure and maintain room inventory.

**Screen: “Inventory / Rooms”**

* Features:

  * Add room types:

    * Room Type Name (e.g., Deluxe, Suite)

### 3.3 Guest Check-In (Staff Initiated)

**Goal**: Hotel staff can check in guests from the panel (walk-ins or bookings).

**Screen: “Check-ins” / “Today’s Check-ins”**

* Tabs:

  * `Pending` (requests from guest self check-in & future reservations arriving today)
  * `Checked-in`
  * `Checked-out`

**Process:**

1. Staff opens “Pending” list.
2. Selects a guest entry (from advance booking or self check-in).
3. Verifies mandatory details (name, ID, number of guests, etc.).
4. Assigns a room:

   * Choose available room from dropdown.
5. Confirms check-in.
6. Entry moves from `Pending` to `Checked-in`.

### 3.4 Advance Bookings

**Goal**: Manage reservations made for future dates.

**Screen: “Bookings”**

* Functions:

    * By date range
    * By status (Confirmed / Pending / Cancelled)

* On the **check-in date**, confirmed bookings appear automatically in **“Today’s Check-ins → Pending”** so staff can convert them to actual stays (check-in).

### 3.5 Billing & Invoices

**Screen: “Billing”**

### 3.6 Soft Bill + Review Link (on Checkout)

**When a guest is checked-out:**

2. System:

   * Marks the stay as checked-out.
   * Frees up the room in inventory for future bookings.
   * Generates final invoice (soft copy).
3. System sends:

4. Guest can:

   * View/download bill.
   * Click review link and submit rating + comments.

## 4. Guest Self Check-In Flow (QR / URL)

This is the second flow you drew at the bottom of the page.

**Goal**: Allow guests to initiate check-in themselves, directly from their phone, and create a record that appears automatically for the hotelier in the “Check-ins” tab and that day’s calendar.

### 4.1 Entry: Scan QR / Open URL

* Each hotel has a unique **QR code and URL** generated in the Superadmin/Hotelier panel.
* QR code is printed and placed at:

  * Reception
  * Lobby
  * Rooms (optional)
* Guest:

  * Scans QR code **or**
  * Types the URL (e.g., `https://easeinn.app/hotel/<hotel-id>/checkin`).

### 4.2 Guest Check-In Page

**Page: “Guest Self Check-In”**

* Displays hotel name and logo.

* Form fields (Mandatory info):

  * Full Name
  * Mobile Number (OTP optional, if you want verification)
  * Email (optional)
  * Number of Guests
  * Check-in Date (default = today)
  * Check-out Date (optional / estimated)
  * Room Type (dropdown) or “Walk-in / Assign at reception”
  * ID Type (Aadhaar, Passport, etc.)
  * ID Number
  * Upload ID photo (optional, if needed later)
  * Purpose of Stay (Business / Leisure / Others)

* Buttons:

  * `Submit Check-In Request`

### 4.3 Creating the Entry

* On form submission:

  * System validates required fields.
  * Creates a new **Pending Check-in Entry** in the hotel’s database, linked to:

    * Hotel ID
    * Guest details
    * Timestamp
  * Status = `Pending Approval`.

### 4.4 How It Reflects in Hotelier Panel

* **Check-ins Tab**

  * The entry appears under:

    * `Today → Pending` list with:

      * Guest Name
      * Arrival Time
      * Number of Guests
      * Room Type (if selected)
      * Source = `Self Check-In (QR/URL)`

* **Calendar View**

  * Under that day’s calendar, the guest appears:

    * Either in a “unassigned” row
    * Or under the selected room type without room number.
  * Hotelier can click the entry, assign a room, and confirm check-in.

### 4.5 Staff Confirmation

1. Receptionist opens “Pending Check-ins”.
2. Selects the guest who just submitted the form.
3. Reviews details & verifies ID physically if required.
4. Assigns a room (if not already).
5. Clicks `Confirm Check-In`.
6. Entry moves to `Checked-in`, room shows as occupied in inventory & calendar.

If you’d like, I can next:

* Turn this into **API requirements + DB schema** (tables, fields) for Replit, or
* Break it down into **frontend pages + backend endpoints** with exact property names.
